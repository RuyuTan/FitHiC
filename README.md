# Fit-Hi-C

[Fit-Hi-C](https://noble.gs.washington.edu/proj/fit-hi-c/) is a tool for assigning statistical confidence estimates to intra-chromosomal contact maps produced by genome-wide genome architecture assays such as Hi-C. Compared to Python original, Fit-Hi-C R port has the following advantages:

- Fit-Hi-C R package is more efficient than Python original by re-writting some logic in C/C++
- Fit-Hi-C R package is easy to use for those familiar with R language without additional configuration
